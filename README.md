# 📚Simple Library App

Hello! My name is Danylo Krupnyk and I am Java Developer! 

This is my simple REST-API application that provides service with implementation of CRUD operations!
The project is made in accordance with the so-called three-tier development dividing the entire business application into:
- Presentation layer-business logic (controllers)
- Application layer (services)
- Data access layer (DAO)

Layering is to achieve "high cohesion, low coupling". The idea of "divide and conquer" is adopted to divide the problem into individual solutions, which is easy to control, easy to extend, and easy to allocate resources.
